**Musicon**
In this project, you will be updating the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon.

Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
